## Introduction

The purpose of this repository aims to provide a hands-on architecture PoC(proof-of-concept) sample that demonstrate how to **build** and **run** a `microservices architecture`(MSA) application(multiple programming languages) with the capabilities of service registry, naming resolution, client service disovery, client load balance, traffic shapping, failure tolerance, etc. 

## PoC Scenario 

The sample contains Java and Node.js modules. In reality, the RPC framework usually are programming language specific, so the challenge for us is how to enable a MSA application with mixed-languages. This sample will show you the approach of service fabric(servicemesh) pattern.

>
> The sample is based on consul connect for the serviemesh. We want to use it to demonsrate the service mesh concepts for a hybrid environments(docker is not the only packing method, mixed deployable types for the service orchestration which could not be achieved by k8s only. cloud-native and on-premise co-exists). Please note, Consule connect was introduced in Consul 1.2 and be marked as beta quality for now, thus, not ready to be used in a production environment.

### Quick Start with a simple echo TCP

Before we get to the PoC sample, let's get a quick start on a simple tcp echo sample to help getting familiar with the consul connect envoy command, and unerstand what exactly it does under the hood.

- Prerequisites 
  - Envoy executable binary(following the [guide](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/tree/master/ci) for a developer build)
  - socat is installed

- Launch a TCP echo server with socat

  ```
  socat -v tcp-l:9090,fork exec:"/bin/cat"
  ```

- Define consul config definitions to file "envoy\_demo.hcl"
  ```
  services {
    name = "client"
    port = 8080
    connect {
      sidecar_service {
        proxy {
          upstreams {
            destination_name = "echo"
            local_bind_port = 9191
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  services {
    name = "echo"
    port = 9090
    connect {
      sidecar_service {}
    }
  }
  ```

- Dump consul service definitions

  ```

                      "LocalBindPort": 9191

      },
      "echo-sidecar-proxy": {
          "Kind": "connect-proxy",

          "EnableTagOverride": false,
          "ProxyDestination": "echo",
          "Proxy": {
              "DestinationServiceName": "echo",
              "DestinationServiceID": "echo",
              "LocalServiceAddress": "127.0.0.1",
              "LocalServicePort": 9090,
              "Upstreams": []
          }
      }
  }
  
  ```

	> As you can see, the `connect.sidecar_service` defintion will be expanded out to a explicit service definition with type `connect-proxy` in consul.

- Launch consul
  ```shell
	cd /vagrant/deployable/
  /opt/consul/bin/consul agent -dev --config-file ./envoy_demo.hcl
  ```
- Start envoy inbound and outbound proxies:

  - Inbound

    ```bash
    /opt/consul/bin/consul connect envoy -sidecar-for echo -admin-bind localhost:19000 -bootstrap > ./bootstrap_echo.json 
    /opt/envoy/bin/envoy --v2-config-only --config-path ./bootstrap_echo.json --disable-hot-restart -l debug
    ```

    Alternatively, 

    ```bash
    /opt/consul/bin/consul connect envoy -sidecar-for echo -admin-bind localhost:19000 -envoy-binary=/opt/envoy/bin/envoy -- -l debug
    ```

	- Outbound

    ```bash
  	/opt/consul/bin/consul connect envoy -sidecar-for client -admin-bind localhost:19001 -bootstrap > ./bootstrap_client.json
  	/opt/envoy/bin/envoy --v2-config-only --config-path ./bootstrap_client.json --disable-hot-restart -l debug
  	```
    
  	Alternatively,
  
  	```bash
  	/opt/consul/bin/consul connect envoy -sidecar-for client -admin-bind localhost:19001 -envoy-binary=/opt/envoy/bin/envoy -- -l debug
  	```

  > The `consule connect` envoy command actually launch envoy with two steps:
	> [1] Generate a bootstrap config file for envoy
	> [2] Launch envoy with the generated bootstrap config

- Run a client on `9191` port

  ```bash
  nc 127.0.0.1 9191
  ```

	Input a string for a echo.

### Run the PoC Sample 

By the time of my writting the doc, envoy integration with nomad is still working in progress thatâ€™s far from being complete, and also, in nomad, the service stanza does not support connect sidecar\_service definitions. so we do not have a easy way to enable dynamical port feature. In below sample, the ports assigned to frontend, add-svc and sub-svc are static, as a result, the services are running with single instance, no replicated service instances running for now.

#### Steps

- Prerequisites 
  - Java
  - Node.js
  - Gradle
  - Envoy executable binary(following the [guide](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/tree/master/ci) for a developer build)

- Git clone the project

	On host:
  ```shell
  git clone git@github.com:leezhenghui/hello-servicemesh-envoy.git
  ```

- Gradle build/deploy distribution
  
  On host:
  ```shell
  cd hello-servicemesh-envoy/modules/frontend
  npm install
  cd ../../
  gradle deploy 
  ```

- Launch VM 
  
	On host:
	```shell
	cd ops
	vagrant up
  ```

- Provision the VM 
  
	On host:
	```shell
	vagrant provision 
  ```

- Start all nomad jobs 
  
	On host:

	```shell
  vagrant ssh
  ```

	In VM
	```shell
  cd /vagrant/bin
	./start_all_jobs.sh
	```

  In addition to start the needed service,  script register sidecar services and start envoy proxies under the hood.

  - sidecar services

  	```
    {
      "name": "add-svc-proxy",
      "kind": "connect-proxy",
      "proxy": {
         "destination_service_name": "add-svc",
         "local_service_address": "10.10.10.150",
         "local_service_port": 9090
       },
       "port": 21000
    }
  	```
  
  	```
    {
      "name": "sub-svc-proxy",
      "kind": "connect-proxy",
      "proxy": {
        "destination_service_name": "sub-svc",
        "local_service_address": "10.10.10.150",
        "local_service_port": 8080
      },
      "port": 21001
    }
  	```
  
  	```
    {
      "name": "add-svc-ref-proxy",
      "kind": "connect-proxy",
      "proxy": {
         "destination_service_name": "frontend",
         "local_service_address": "10.10.10.150",
         "local_service_port": 7070,
         "upstreams": [{
            "destination_type": "service",
            "destination_name": "add-svc",
            "local_bind_address": "127.0.0.1",
            "local_bind_port": 9191
          }]
       },
  	   "port": 21002
    }
  	```
  
  	```
  	{
      "name": "sub-svc-ref-proxy",
      "kind": "connect-proxy",
      "proxy": {
         "destination_service_name": "frontend",
         "local_service_address": "10.10.10.150",
         "local_service_port": 7070,
         "upstreams": [{
            "destination_type": "service",
            "destination_name": "sub-svc",
            "local_bind_address": "127.0.0.1",
            "local_bind_port": 8181
          }]
        },
        "port": 21003
  	}
  	```
	- Bootstrap envoy proxies

  	```
    consul connect envoy -sidecar-for add-svc  -proxy-id add-svc-proxy     -admin-bind localhost:19000 -envoy-binary=/opt/envoy/bin/envoy -- -l debug
  	
    consul connect envoy -sidecar-for sub-svc  -proxy-id sub-svc-proxy     -admin-bind localhost:19001 -envoy-binary=/opt/envoy/bin/envoy -- -l debug
  	
    consul connect envoy -sidecar-for frontend -proxy-id add-svc-ref-proxy -admin-bind localhost:19002 -envoy-binary=/opt/envoy/bin/envoy -- -l debug
    
    consul connect envoy -sidecar-for frontend -proxy-id sub-svc-ref-proxy -admin-bind localhost:19003 -envoy-binary=/opt/envoy/bin/envoy -- -l debug
  	```

- Run the sample 

  In VM:
	```shell
	./click.sh
  ```

- Run benchmark 

  In VM:
	```shell
	./benchmark.sh
  ```
